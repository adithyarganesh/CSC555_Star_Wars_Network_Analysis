# CSC555_StarWars_Network_Analysis

# Important Information
All the code was run from a NC State Macbook Air using the python version 3.8.

# Description
The code to analyse the star wars dataset to check 5 tasks have been implemented.

# Implementation
The code is implemented in a single package called P1.py. This code will be
called as follows:
- python3 P1.py for explicit call if python P1.py doesn't compile with the correct interpreter.

Please find in the repository a copy of the notebook file that shows complete information of the tasks that have been run.
If the jupyter notebook exists, the P1.ipynb file can also be run block by block for better implementation.

character_side.json contains annotation of which side the character belongs to.
- Light side: 1
- Dark side: 2
##### There is a block of commented code that saves the random graphs into the task3_results folder. If the graphs need to be double checked, kindly uncomment the blocks for verification. However, all the graphs for the tasks are already present in the task3_results and task4_results folders respectively.

# Results
All the results have been analysed and the analysis metrics have been explained in detail in P1.pdf attached here as well as uploaded in the moodle portal
